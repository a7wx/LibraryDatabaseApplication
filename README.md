# LibraryApplication
CPTR-319 LibraryApplication
This is my database project for CPTR_319 for the W22 Semester.  it is a library application intended for use by a librarian.
The user has the ability to put new books, geners, series, authors, users, librarians, and orders into the database for storage.
The user can also read the data for books, geners, series, authors, users, librarians, and orders.
The user can update values for books, genres, series, authors, users, librarians, and orders.
The user can delete books, authors and series from the database.

This application was made using a sqlLite database

I have unfortunately run out of time for this project so it is missing some functionality I intended to put in.
The user does not have the ability to filter their searches in any manner, which while not removing any functionality from the database
would make finding an entity in a large dataset difficult.  

I have also run out of time so there are bugs present.  I have not had the time to identify them all but I do know their are some in existence surrounding 
deletion of entitys with foreign keys.  I was also having an issue with the data storing after a crash.
