# LibraryApplication
CPTR-319 (Database Management Systems)
This is my database project for CPTR 319 May of 2022.  it is a library application intended for use by a librarian.
The user has the ability to put new books, geners, series, authors, users, librarians, and orders into the database forstorage.
The user can also read the data for books, geners, series, authors, users, librarians, and orders.
The user can update values for books, genres, series, authors, users, librarians, and orders.
The user can delete books, authors and series from the database.

This application was made using a sqlLite database

This project is missing some key functionality that would aid ease of use.  The user does not have the ability to filter their 
searches in any manner, which while not removing any functionality from the databasewould make finding an entity in a large 
dataset difficult.
